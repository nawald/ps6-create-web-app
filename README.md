# ps6-create-web-app
Your task is to build your own shiny application. The application should provide the user with the
ability to interactively explore the dataset you chose. What the application looks like is up to you,
but see the sample app https://otoomet.shinyapps.io/uah-lower-troposphere/.
The visualization can be made with base R graphics, ggplot2, plotly, leaflet for maps or some-
thing else. While we donâ€™t expect you to create anything ground-breaking, we do expect you to
create a clear visualization with proper labels and titles. And of course, the graphic needs to react
to changing values in the widgets.
