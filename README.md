# ps6-create-web-app
This project takes a data set from the City of Seattle containing information about the demographics
of their staff and turns it into a Shiny web app. The web app contains three pages. 
The first page is the Introduction, and contains a brief description of the data on a side panel and a sample of the data set. 
The second page is the Plot page. The main panel contains a plot of the wages of City of Seattle staff, whom are grouped by race/ethicity. The side panel here contains two widgets, one that lets the user choose the race they want to view on the graph and another that changes the color of the graph's
points. Finally, we have the Table page. This page contains a main panel of a table of the average wage of City of Seattle employees per race.
The side panel has a widget that allows the user to select the race who's average wage they wish to view.
